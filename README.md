DOMAIN: Botanical research
• CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample
images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a
photo

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo
Steps and tasks:
1. Import the data. Analyse the dimensions of the data. Visualise the data.
2. Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
• Use supervised learning algorithms for training
• Use neural networks for training
• Use CNN for training
3. Compare the results from the above step along with your detailed observations.
4. Pickle the best performing model.
5. Import the the image in the “ Prediction” folder to predict the class. Display the image. Use the best trained image
classifier model to predict the class.
